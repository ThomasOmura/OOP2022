#Text from course
#Maksimum points from each exercise is 
# 10 and from all exercises is 120
#less than 60 points -> grade 0
#60 points -> grade 1
#72 points -> grade 2
#84 points -> grade 3
#96 points -> grade 4
#108 points -> grade 5


#Ask for point_input = 'integer'

#if point_input >'120':
    # print can not be over 120.
#elif point_input => '108'
#between 108 and 120 the grade is 5
    #print '[Student] has grade 5.'

#elif point_input => '96'
#between 96 and 108 the grade is 4
    #print '[Student] has grade 4.'

#elif point_input => '84'
#between 84 and 96 the grade is 3
    #print '[Student] has grade 3.'

#elif point_input => '72'
#between 72 and 84 the grade is 2
    #print '[Student] has grade 2.'

#elif point_input => '60'
#between 60 and 72 the grade is 1
    #print '[Student] has grade 1.'

#else:
#Bigger as and 108 = grade 5
